#### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

#### Learning Goals
* Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of:
DRY JavaScript
* Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

#### Project Overview
_In this project the user can play the game Tic-Tac-Toe. To win the game, the player must occupy three spaces in a row. The spaces can be in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row to win. If neither player gets three in a row then the game is declared a tie. If the user wishes, they can click the 'New Game' button to reset the board and begin again. Every time a player wins the win count next to each players icon adds up by one. On the top of the board the game tells the player whose turn it is._

#### Install Instructions
